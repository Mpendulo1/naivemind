## Add dotnev files
Manually add a dotenv file to the react and server application folders to keep our secrets

```
-Secrests to be sent over more secure channels-

Add the dotenv files at the root of the directories - see image below

## Run app

```
yarn run dev
```
Run the command above from the root of the server folder to run the client and server apps concurrently. 

> :warning: **If you are using npm**: The app may fail to run because of discrepancies in the way _yarn_ and _npm_ handle relative paths! Use yarn to ensure the app works.

| WARNING: Also, if you wish or have to change the server port number, remember to also change it on the proxy setting in the client app's package.json! |
